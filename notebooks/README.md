## Project Overview
Tax non-compliance poses a significant challenge for Tax agencies. Limited resources make it difficult to audit every taxpayer, yet undetected high-risk cases can lead to substantial revenue loss. This project develops a predictive model that classifies taxpayers into high, medium, or low non-compliance risk, enabling more focused audits and better compliance strategies.

## Business Understanding
### Stakeholder
National Tax Enforcement Agency (Audit & Compliance Teams)

### Business problem
Audit and enforcement teams lack a data-driven approach to identify and prioritize risky taxpayers. Current methods are largely manual, reactive, and inefficient leading to wasted resources and missed cases of non-compliance.

To address this, we aim to:

Predict tax non-compliance risk.
Identify key features/factors influencing non-compliance.
Provide actionable insights to audit teams for targeted enforcement decisions.

## Data Understanding
The dataset in use was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/tax-risk-identification-dataset?resource=download) The dataset includes anonymized taxpayer information such as:
1. Revenue
2. Expenses
3. Tax Liability
4. Tax Paid
5. Profit
6. Late Filings
7. Compliance Violations
8. Audit Findings
9. Industry
10. Risk label

This dataset  is a historical record of taxpayers reflecting both financial performance and behavioral history.
